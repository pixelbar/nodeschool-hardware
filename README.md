[üë®‚Äçüíª Run code](#rerequisites)

## üëÄ Prerequisites

- Microcontroller: Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3
- Components: breadboard, wires, LEDs, buttons, and PIM board
- USB-C cable to connect microcontroller to your computer
- A computer
- Basic JavaScript knowledge: [JS for cats](http://jsforcats.com/)

## üìö Getting started

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 recommended, check by running `node -v` in your terminal)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. Install [DeviceScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devicescript.devicescript-vscode) extension for Visual Studio Code
4. Clone or download this project
   - Download: https://github.com/pixelbar/nodeschool-hardware/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   - Clone: `git clone https://github.com/pixelbar/nodeschool-hardware.git`
5. Open the cloned directory in Visual Studio Code
6. Install dependencies
   - Run in terminal: `npm install`

## üöÄ Connecting the microcontroller to your computer

1. Connect the microcontroller to your computer using a USB-C cable
2. Open Visual Studio Code, make sure you have the DeviceScript extension installed
3. Open the DeviceScript panel (1)
4. Click on "Connect Device" (2)
5. A prompt will appear, select "Serial" (3)
6. The device should now appear in the panel

## üë®‚Äçüíª Run code

To run your code on the microcontroller, first follow the connection steps above, then open `src/main.ts` and press the run button in the upper-right corner.

1. Follow the steps for connecting the microcontroller above.
2. Open `src/main.ts`
3. Press the run button in the upper-right corner (1)
4. A panel should appear on the bottom or right side of the screen (2). The panel shows the output of your code (e.g., any `console.log`s in your code).
5. VS Code may prompt to start the DeviceScript simulator. You can press "Don't show again". If you're interested in simulation, learn more [here](https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/developer/simulation).
6. To stop the output, disconnect the device, or press `Ctrl+C` in the output panel (2)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Flashing the microcontroller

The microcontroller comes pre-flashed with the DeviceScript firmware. An update to DeviceScript might require you to re-flash the microcontroller.

1. Connect the microcontroller to your computer using a USB-C cable
2. Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (`Command+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux) and enter "flash".

![](media/flash.png)

1. Select `DeviceScript: Flash Firmware...`
2. You'll be prompted to select a device, search for "seeed studio" and select `Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3`

3. A command prompt should appear on the bottom or the side of your editor, wait until it says "flash OK". You can now reconnect to the device.

If you're experiencing any problems you can try to clean the flash, follow steps 1 and 2, and select `DeviceScript: Clean Flash...`.

## Project 1: Blinky

![](media/blinky.jpeg)

For the first project we'll create what is known as the "hello world" for hardware, we'll make an LED blink!

![](media/lesson_1.png)

Connect the components according to the schematic displayed above.

You can find the code for this project in `src/blinky.ts`. To run the code, replace the contents of `src/main.ts` with `import "./blinky";`. Play around with the code, e.g., change the interval in which the LED blinks up.

## Project 2: Input

![](media/input.jpeg)

We'll now use a button to make the LED light up.

![](media/lesson_2.png)

You can find the code for this project in `src/blinky.ts`. To run the code, replace the contents of `src/main.ts` with `import "./input";`. Play around with the code, e.g., dim the LED on a button press (tip: add `dimmable: true` to `startLightBulb`).

## Project 3: PIM

![PIM board connected to ESP32](media/pim.jpeg)

Now let's connect PIM. PIM is a custom designed PCB - which means you don't need a breadboard anymore. It contains 4 buttons and 4 LEDs. You can find the code for this project in `src/pim.ts`. To run the code, replace the contents of `src/main.ts` with `import "./pim";`.

The provided example demonstrates the basic functionality of toggling an LED on or off in response to a button press.

Experiment with the code, e.g., make the LEDs blink up in some sequence.

## Project 4: it's your turn!

Now it's your turn to play around with the hardware and software! You can extend any of the above projects, or create something new. Here are some ideas:

- Create a digital dice roller with the PIM.
- Create a reaction time game where a random LED serves as the target. You can even post the reaction times to a server to create a high-score list!
- Create Simon Says.
- Create a temperature sensor that publishes to MQTT. A temperature sensor (SHT30) is provided! You can follow this guide: https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/samples/temperature-mqtt. Note: you'll have to make some adjustments for the hardware provided. MQTT is a protocol specifically designed to send and receive small messages, especially dealing with IoT devices. You can use the [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) to inspect the messages being sent.

Refer to the pinout diagram below when connecting components.
