# NodeSchool Rotterdam - JavaScript Ã— Hardware workshop

## Prerequisites

- Microcontroller: Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3
- Components: breadboard, wires, LEDs, buttons, and PIM board
- USB-C cable to connect microcontroller to your computer
- A computer
- Basic JavaScript knowledge (!!!TODO: link to learn)

## Getting started

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 recommended, check by running `node -v` in your terminal)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. Install [DeviceScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devicescript.devicescript-vscode) extension for Visual Studio Code
4. Clone or download this project
   - Download: https://github.com/pixelbar/nodeschool-hardware/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   - Clone: `git clone https://github.com/pixelbar/nodeschool-ai.git`
5. Open the cloned directory in Visual Studio Code
6. Install dependencies
   - Run in terminal: `npm install`

## Connecting the microcontroller to your computer

1. Connect the microcontroller to your computer using a USB-C cable
2. Open Visual Studio Code, make sure you have the DeviceScript extension installed
3. Open the DeviceScript panel (1)
4. Click on "Connect Device" (2)
5. A prompt will appear, select "Serial" (3)
6. The device should now appear in the panel

## Run code

To run your code on the microcontroller, first follow the connection steps above, then open `src/main.ts` and press the run button in the upper-right corner.

1. Follow the steps for connecting the microcontroller above.
2. Open `src/main.ts`
3. Press the run button in the upper-right corner (1)*
4. A panel should appear on the bottom or right side of the screen (2). The panel shows the output of your code (e.g., any `console.log`s in your code).
5. VS Code may prompt to start the DeviceScript simulator. You can press "Don't show again". If you're interested in simulation, learn more [here](https://microsoft.github.io/devicescript/developer/simulation).

## Flashing the microcontroller

The microcontroller comes pre-flashed with the DeviceScript firmware. An update to DeviceScript might require you to re-flash the microcontroller.

1. Connect the microcontroller to your computer using a USB-C cable
2. Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (`Command+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux) and enter "flash".

3. Select `DeviceScript: Flash Firmware...`
4. You'll be prompted to select a device, search for "seeed studio" and select `Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3`
